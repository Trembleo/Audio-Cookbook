# Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Digital Audio

**1. The Nature of Sound**

* **Sound Waves:** Sound travels as mechanical waves through a medium, generated by vibrating objects.
* **Properties of Sound:**
    * **Frequency:** The number of vibrations per second, measured in Hertz (Hz), determines the pitch of the sound.
    * **Amplitude:** The magnitude of the vibration, determines the loudness or volume of the sound.
    * **Wavelength:** The distance the wave travels in one cycle.
    * **Phase:** The state of the wave at a particular moment in time.

**2. Analog Audio vs. Digital Audio**

* **Analog Audio:** A continuous electrical signal that varies in voltage or current to represent sound, such as the raw signal captured by a microphone.
* **Digital Audio:** Represents sound using a sequence of discrete numbers.
* **Why Digitalize?**
    * Easy to store and transmit.
    * Convenient for various Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithms.
    * More resistant to noise and interference.
    * Allows for lossless or lossy compression.

**3. Digital Audio Acquisition and Representation**

* **Sampling:** The process of taking discrete snapshots (samples) of the continuous analog signal at regular intervals in time.
    * **Sampling Rate:** The number of samples taken per second, measured in Hertz (Hz). Common sampling rates include:
        * 8 kHz (Telephone speech)
        * 44.1 kHz (CD quality)
        * 48 kHz (Professional audio)
        * 96 kHz or higher (High-resolution audio)
    * **Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem:** To perfectly reconstruct the original signal, the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency present in the signal.
* **Quantization:** The process of assigning a discrete numerical value to each sample, representing its amplitude.
    * **Bit Depth:** The number of bits used to represent each sample, which determines the dynamic range and precision of the audio. Common bit depths include:
        * 8 bit (Lower quality)
        * 16 bit (CD quality)
        * 24 bit or higher (High-resolution audio)
* **Encoding:** The process of formatting the quantized samples into a specific digital audio format for storage or transmission.

**4. Key Digital Audio Concepts**

* **Nyquist Frequency:** Equal to half the sampling rate, it is the highest frequency that can be accurately represented by a digital system.
* **Aliasing:** If the signal contains frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency, these frequencies can be misinterpreted as lower frequencies after sampling, leading to distortion. Anti-aliasing filters are typically used before sampling to prevent this.
* **Resolution:** Determined by the bit depth, a higher bit depth provides higher resolution, allowing for the capture of finer details and a wider dynamic range.
* **Dynamic Range:** The difference between the loudest and quietest sounds that can be represented, usually measured in decibels (dB), and is related to the bit depth.
* **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):** The ratio of the power of the desired signal to the power of the background noise, an important measure of audio quality.
* **Bitrate:** The number of bits transmitted or stored per second, measured in bits per second (bps). For uncompressed audio, the bitrate is directly related to the sampling rate and bit depth. For compressed audio, the bitrate reflects the compression efficiency and audio quality.

**5. Common Digital Audio Formats**

* **Uncompressed Formats:**
    * WAV (Waveform Audio File Format)
    * AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format)
* **Lossless Compression Formats:**
    * FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec)
    * ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec)
* **Lossy Compression Formats:**
    * MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer III)
    * AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)
    * OGG Vorbis

**6. Advantages of Digital Audio**

* Easy to store and manage.
* Convenient for editing and processing.
* Allows for precise duplication and transmission.
* Enables the implementation of various complex audio algorithms.
